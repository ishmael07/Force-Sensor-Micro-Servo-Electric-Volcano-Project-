#README 

Welcome to My GitHub! It's relatively new, but this is probably my first project on GitHub Here.

Project Name: "The Electric Volcano"
Risk Level: 3/10
Stress Level: 11/10 (I did the work for you dw)
Purpose: Code in C++ to turn on Micro Servo Motor when Force/Touch/Weight is detected on the Force Sensor.
Materials: Force Sensor (FSR), Micro Servo Motor, Arduino Uno R3, Breadboard, Jumper Wires, LEDs
Used for: Arduino, C++, Circuits 

NOTE: PLEASE CALIBRATE YOUR DEVICE. I'm not responsible if you short a circuit or something goes wrong with the
micro servo (very unlikely), but make sure to change the values in your code to your liking.
